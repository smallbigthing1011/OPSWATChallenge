## Front-end of the OPSWAT UI Challenge

This front-end side covers the following features

```
- User Login
- User Registration
- Show your user profile
- Edit your user profile
- List/Delete User (not yourself)
- List/Create Articles
```

Further features can be updated later (the lack of the required features are caused from my personal issues).

## Usage for the front-end

        cd client
        npm start

        (it would be better if you start the server side first)

        cd server
        npm start
